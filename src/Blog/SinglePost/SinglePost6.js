                         You want to leave the best impression on your job interview…
                         <br/><br/>
                    ...And what’s a better way to do that than by dressing for the job you’re applying for?
                    <br/> <br/>
                    Dressing snappy can show the interviewer that you’re serious about the job, and at the same time, good at presenting yourself.
                    <br/> <br/>

                    Choosing the right outfit, though, isn’t all that easy. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all formula on what to wear for YOUR job interview.   </p>
                    <br/> <br/>
                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">What to Wear on an Interview For Men
</h2>                    <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">Suit & Tie
</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont">
                         Suit & Tie is the classical interview attire choice for men. If you’re being interviewed for a senior role in management, or just at a company with a strict dress code (Banking, Law Firm, etc.), Suite & Tie is the best choice.

                         <br/><br/>If you don’t want to wear a generic black suit and white shirt under, you can go for a grey suit and light blue shirt. 

                         <br/><br/>Or you can be creative and put a cardigan or sweater underneath (as long as it’s not +40° outside, anyway).

                         </p>
                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">A Sweater & a Button - Down</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont">
                         If the company you’re applying for has a more business-casual dress code, you won’t go wrong with a sweater with a button-down shirt underneath.
                         <br/><br/>
                         You can choose a neutral color for the sweater like grey, brown or black since these match with shirts of just about any color.
                         <br/><br/>     
                         You can pair the sweater/shirt combo with khakis, chinos or dress pants if you want to be a bit more formal. 

                         </p>

                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">Light Colored Jacket & Pants</h2>

                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont" style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }}>
                         If a suit & tie is too official but a sweater and a button-down are too casual, there’s a middle ground between the two! 
                         <br/><br/>     
                         A light-colored jacket or a blazer is less formal than a black suit coat but it still has a very stylish feel to it.
                         <br/><br/>     
                         You can always go for a khaki jacket, a shirt underneath, and a pair of dress pants. 
                         </p>

                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">Button-Down & Pants</h2>

                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont" style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }}>
                         Another semi-formal option is a plain button-down and a pair of dress pants. Don’t go for bright colors or overcrowded shirt patterns, though, that’s just distracting. 
                         <br/><br/>
                         Go for colors that compliment you and are subtle. For example, simple pastel color for the shirt and a neutral color for the pants will do the job.
                         <br/>
                         </p>


                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">Shoes</h2>

                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont" style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }}>
                         Don’t think that your shoes will go unnoticed. Wear freshly-polished comfortable classic shoes in the dark color range. 
                         <br/><br/>
                         And don’t forget to put socks that match your shoe and pants color. If you go for black shoes, don’t wear white socks. They might not show when you’re standing but once you sit down, everyone will be able to see them.

                         </p>

                            <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">What to Wear on an Interview For Women</h2>
                            <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">Button-down Shirts & Trousers</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont" style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }}>
                         A button-down shirt is always a good choice when it comes to looking professional. You can choose from the classic black or white shirt, or go for light blue or pink. When it comes to the fabric, you also have a lot of choices from silk chiffon, linen to cotton. Just make sure you feel comfortable in it! 
                         <br/><br/>
                         Combine that shirt with a pair of stylish trousers and you will have a very classy professional look at your interview. 
                         <br/><br/>
                         Just don’t forget to have your bra covered and invisible under the shirt and choose a modest neckline when it comes to the shirt style. 
                         </p>

                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">Blazer & Blouse</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont" style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }}>
                         If you want to add a bit of elegance to your style, go for a classy blue blazer with a blouse underneath. 
                         <br/><br/>
                         And if you choose a blouse with an interesting design, you can always take off the blazer. 
                         <br/><br/>
                         You can also combine that outfit with either a skirt or trousers that match the blazer’s color and fabric. 
                         <br/><br/>
                         As for the blazer, its sleeves should end at your wrists. Otherwise, if you have super long sleeves, it might look awkward and too big on you. Also, when you choose a blazer, make sure it fits you well - not too tight and not too baggy. 
                          </p>

                          <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading"> Black Dress & Tights</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont" style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }}>
                        
                         The classy black dress is another go-to option for your job interview. Just make sure that the dress is appropriate and professionally looking for the occasion. It should be at least knee-length and you should not show any cleavage.
                         <br/><br/>
                         Combining the dress with textured tights and classy black heels gives you a simple but elegant look.
                         </p>
                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading"> Shoes</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont" style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }}>
                        
                         A job interview is probably not the best place to try on your new stilettos. You don’t want to stumble or walk awkwardly across the office because you can barely remain balanced on your high heels. 
                         <br/><br/>
                         So, sticking to closed-toe flats or low heels that you know are comfortable for sure is your best choice. Also, make sure they’re not scuffed, look representable, and are a neutral color that matches the rest of your outfit.
