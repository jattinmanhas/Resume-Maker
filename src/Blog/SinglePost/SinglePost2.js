                            <b>What is a resume job description? When you hear the words “job description” your first thought is probably what you see in job ads. Literally the description of the job, its duties, and requirements.</b>

                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">How to Write a Job Description on Resume</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont">It’s worth repeating that this is the single most important part of your resume. For many recruiters and hiring managers it’s the only section that counts, so you need to make sure your job description is polished to perfection. Here’s how.
                         </p>
                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">1. Use a Clear Heading</h2>
                         <p style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }} className="singlePostDesc_cont">
                         Label your job description section using one of the following titles:

                              <br/>
                              <li className="padding_space">Work Experience</li>
                              <br />
                              <li className="padding_space">Work History</li>
                              <br />

                              <li className="padding_space">Employment History
                              </li><br />
                              <li className="padding_space">Professional Experience
                              </li><br /> <br />
                              You should set your heading in a resume font that’s larger than the body text of your job descriptions. You can also use bold or ALL CAPS for added emphasis.
                              
                         </p>

                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">2. Put It in the Right Place</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont">For most candidates, your resume job description should be the first section of your resume proper, following immediately after your resume introduction. However, if you’ve just graduated or you’re still studying you can put it after your education section. Here’s the standard order of resume sections for a chronological resume.

                         </p>
                         
                         <p style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }} className="singlePostDesc_cont">
                              
                              <li className="padding_space">Name and Job Title</li>
                              
                              <li className="padding_space">Contact Information</li>
     

                              <li className="padding_space">Resume Introduction (Summary or Objective)
                              </li>
                              <li className="padding_space">Education
                              </li>
                              <li className="padding_space">Resume Job Description
                              </li>
                              
                              <li className="padding_space">Additional Sections (e.g. Certifications, Hobbies and Interests)
                              </li>
                              
                              <br /> <br />
                               
                         </p>
                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">3. Follow the Right Format
</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont">Your resume job description should always be presented in reverse chronological format. Your most recent or current job comes first, then you work back from there. Which raises the question, how far back should a resume go?

                         </p>
                         
                         <p style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }} className="singlePostDesc_cont">
                              
                         And the answer is around 10–15 years, as long as it's relevant 
                         experience. But that figure isn’t set in stone and will vary
                          according to your work history, whether you have employment gaps
                           and whether you have a lot of freelance experience. 

                              <br /> 
                              
                              <br />
                              The key takeaway is as long as your experience is relevant and your resume is targeted 
                              to the ad job description, you don’t have to stick to a one-page resume.
                               A two-page resume or even three pages is fine for experienced candidates.
                               
                         </p>

                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">4. Stick to a Standard and Consistent Layout</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont">Start off each entry in your resume job description with the same basic information. 

                         </p>
                         
                         <p style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }} className="singlePostDesc_cont">
                         You should include: 
                         <br/>
                              <li className="padding_space">Your job title</li>
                              
                              <li className="padding_space">The name of the employer</li>
     

                              <li className="padding_space">Location of your workplace
                              </li>
                              <li className="padding_space">Dates of employment. Using “present” as the end date if you still work there.

                              </li>
                              
                              <br /> <br />
                              You can use bold or italics to highlight important information, but be consistent with any formatting you choose to use.
                              <br/>
                              Then follow up with 3–6 bullet points that describe your job responsibilities. Use a higher number of bullet points for more recent and more relevant experience, and fewer for older and less relevant experience.

                              <br/>
                         </p>

                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">5. Optimize Your Bullet Points</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont">It’s not enough to just throw in a few bullet points and hope for the best. They’re a great addition to your resume job description but to give them maximum impact you should ensure they’re perfectly optimized. Here’s how to do it:

                         </p>
                         
                         <p style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }} className="singlePostDesc_cont">
                         You should include: 
                         <br/>
                              <li className="padding_space">Start off each bullet point with a high energy resume action word. Nothing is more boring than a job description where every bullet point starts with “responsible for.”
                              </li>
                              
                              <li className="padding_space">Structure your bullet points to maximize your professional achievements. It’s not enough to just list what you did, you need to show how well you did it. And the best way to do that is to use accomplishment statements.
                              </li>
     

                              <li className="padding_space">Location of your workplacUse active voice and simple language. The recruiter reading your resume won’t necessarily understand complex, job-specific business jargon.

e
                              </li>
                              <li className="padding_space">Describe your past duties and accomplishments in the past tense. Use present tense on your resume only for the things you still do.

                              </li>
                              
                              <br /> <br />
                              
                         </p>

                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">6. Target Your Resume Job Description</h2>
                         <p className="singlePostDesc_cont">Don’t just copy and paste a job description in your resume for every application you make. Take the time to tailor your resume job description to the unique requirements of each job. Do that by carefully reading the job ad, noting all the key requirements mentioned, and then mention examples of your own skills and experience that prove you’ll be a good fit.


                         </p>
                         
                         <h2 className="singlepostDesc_heading">7. Include Keywords</h2>
                         <p style={{ marginBottom: '5rem' }} className="singlePostDesc_cont">
                         Why do you need to include keywords in your resume job description you ask? The reality is that your application is likely to be assessed by an algorithm before it gets read by a human. Most companies use ATS resume software to scan incoming applications.

                         <br/>
                         That software seeks out keywords to help it decide whether to accept or reject an application. Just as with targeting your resume, use the job ad as your guide and look for the following types of keywords to include in your job description: 
                         <br/>
                              <li className="padding_space">Hard skills such as specific computer skills </li>
                              
                              <li className="padding_space">Soft skills such as leadership and communication   </li>
     

                              <li className="padding_space">The correct job title

                              </li>
                              But don’t just spam keywords. Ensure your resume job description retains a smooth and natural flow. And only include keywords for skills and experience you actually have. It should go without saying but lying on a resume is never an option.
                              
                              <br /> <br />
                              
                         </p>
                    </div>

               </div>
               
          </div>
     );
